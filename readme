🌌 APOD – Astronomy Picture of the Day (iOS)

An iOS application built using SwiftUI that displays NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) with a focus on performance, clean architecture, and native iOS user experience.

This project was developed as part of a company technical assignment with a strict time constraint.

📱 Features
Core Functionality

📅 View today’s APOD on app launch

🕰 Select APOD for any date using a wheel-style date picker

⬅️➡️ Swipe horizontally to navigate to previous or next days

🖼 Progressive image loading (low-res first, HD later)

🔍 Fullscreen Photos-style image viewer

🤏 Pinch & double-tap to zoom (cannot zoom out smaller than screen)

⬇️ Pull down to dismiss fullscreen image

💾 Save image to Photos

📤 Share image using native iOS share sheet

🎨 UI / UX Design

Built entirely with SwiftUI

Uses glass / material-based UI (ultraThinMaterial)

Dark, immersive fullscreen image viewer

Subtle animations and gesture feedback

Follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines

Minimal, distraction-free design

🧠 Architecture

MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)

HomeViewModel handles:

API requests

State management

Error handling

Views are kept declarative and lightweight

Clear separation between:

Networking

UI logic

Presentation logic

🌐 Networking

Uses NASA APOD API

Implemented using async/await

Prevents duplicate API calls using date tracking

Graceful handling of:

Network failures

Invalid responses

Unsupported media types

🚀 Performance Optimizations

Progressive image loading

Low-resolution image loads immediately

High-resolution image upgrades silently when available

ViewModel is agnostic of image resolution

Smooth perceived performance even on slow networks

🔐 Security & Configuration

Sensitive configuration is not committed to the repository.

API Key Handling

Uses an .xcconfig file for secrets

Secrets.xcconfig is ignored by Git

A template file is provided for setup

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

2️⃣ Create Secrets file

Copy Secrets.xcconfig.example

Rename it to Secrets.xcconfig

3️⃣ Add your NASA API key
API_KEY = YOUR_NASA_API_KEY


You can get a free API key from: https://api.nasa.gov

4️⃣ Open the project in Xcode

Select an iOS Simulator or real device

Build & run

🧪 Permissions Required

The app requests the following permissions:

Photo Library (Add Only) – to save images to Photos

Make sure the following keys exist in Info.plist:

NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription

NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription

🧭 Gesture Guide
Gesture	Action
Swipe Left	Go to next day
Swipe Right	Go to previous day
Pinch	Zoom in
Double Tap	Toggle zoom
Pull Down	Dismiss fullscreen image
🛠 Trade-offs & Decisions

Given the limited time:

Focused on stability and UX over feature count

Did not implement persistent storage for favourites

Did not add video playback for APOD videos

These were conscious decisions to prioritize quality over quantity.

🔮 Possible Improvements

Persistent favourites using Core Data

Offline caching of APOD content

APOD video playback support

Accessibility enhancements

Background prefetching

Unit tests for ViewModel

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

Swift

SwiftUI

Combine (light usage)

Async/Await

URLSession

Photos Framework

📝 Notes

This project demonstrates:

Strong SwiftUI fundamentals

Modern iOS APIs

Thoughtful UX decisions

Clean and maintainable architecture

Real-world handling of edge cases

✅ Final Note

This project was intentionally scoped to demonstrate engineering judgment, not just feature implementation.
